# Game Options

For your first game you will be using one of the Unity Creator Kits. Your options are:

- [Creator Kit: First Person Shooter (FPS)](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-fps " (opens in a new window)")
- [Creator Kit: Puzzle](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-puzzle " (opens in a new window)")
- [Creator Kit: Role Playing Game (RPG)](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg " (opens in a new window)")

# Directions

Once you have selected one of the above tutorial series you will need to follow along and complete that tutorial series. Regardless of the tutorial chosen you will be learning the basics of how to use the Unity game engine, set up projects, and manipulate assets and game objects.

While creating your game you are welcome to add any extra assets, features, or elements that you want, as long as you complete each of the steps in your selected tutorial series. Once you have completed your game you will need to upload a final .zip file here. You are also expected to include a Git Hub repository link with your final project.

## To Turn In

Once you have completed your game you will need to write a  **readme file** . This must be a **plain text file (.txt)** and should include a **link to your project Git Hub repo** ( *this must be made public in order for me to access it!* ) In this readme file, you must also include a **link to a video demo of your project** ( *it is recommended that this is a youtube video, unlisted if you want, and must use screen capture software, such as [Open Broadcast Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/ " (opens in a new window)")* ). This demo video should show your game running while you explain what you did, what struggles you had, and what you are proud of. Aim for a 2-3 minute demo.

You will also need to export your game as a  **windows executable file (.exe)** , keep in mind that *the executable build you produce in Unity will not work unless you include the associated resource files!*

You then need to put the readme file and windows executable into a .zip archive and upload it here.

## For full points you need:

1. A readme file with:
   - A public link to your project Git Hub repo
   - A link to a demo video of your project
2. An executable file with all resource files
   - This executable must be a windows .exe file

# IMPORTANT NOTES

Videos of your PC screen captured with a phone will not be accepted. This will result in a zero for the video component of this project.

Failure to include the resource files with your exe will result in a zero for the project. Additionally, turning in a different executable file (i.e. Mac App or WebGL files) will result in a zero. If I cannot play your game, I cannot grade your game!
