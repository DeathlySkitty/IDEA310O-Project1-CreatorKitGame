# Directions & Reason

The goal of this assignment was for students to use a pre-made game kit with a tutorial to give them a start on how to use Unity.  Each student was given three options:

- [Creator Kit: First Person Shooter](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-fps)
- [Creator Kit: Puzzle](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-puzzle)
- [Creator Kit: Role Playing Game (RPG)](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg)

Once you selected one of the tutorial series you would follow along and complete the series.  The tutorial goes over how to use quick key features, use the project board, understanding how to add data and assets, etc.  

Once the game is completed you will need to **turn in**:

- final .zip file of your completed game 
- readme file 
- link to your project GitHub repo
- link to a video demo of your project 
- export your game as a windows executable file (.exe)
