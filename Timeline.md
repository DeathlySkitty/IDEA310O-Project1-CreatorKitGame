# Game Overview
The player (You), aka the doctor is trying to help his patient heal from an infection and it is your job to go into the patients body and destroy all the germs that are causing issues.  You have been shrunk down so you can explore the veins and body of the patient.  

Inside the patient you will have to find all the germs and destroy them to collect all the keys that allow you to unlock more parts of the body.  (Why there are doors in the body, I'm not sure, just don't ask... maybe it's a condition).  Anyways, you will have to explore the brain, the stomach, the heart, and various veins in the body in order to heal your patient.  

You are given a couple different weapons that have infinite reload-ability so you never run out of ammo.  You have a semi-auto pistol, automatic rifle, pill grenade, and a semi-auto rifle.  You can scroll through either of these at any time.  

You will explore the patients body until you have killed all the germs, found all the keys, and unlocked all the doors which will allow you to exit the body (end the level).  


# Time Table

## Thursday, January 30, 2025

**Unity Version**: 2022.3.56

- Played through the game and it worked perfectly
- Created this timeline to keep track of what I did and what happened 
- Reformatted the game so it was placed within the GitHub folder so that the game can be continuously updated and accessed anywhere.  All the basics of the tutorial kit are placed within the game.  

## Sunday, February 2, 2025
- Went through the tutorial more and created a game level, targets, and some basic formatting.  
- Copied and adjusted the targets to create my own kind of target with different health and damage.  

## Thursday, February 6, 2025
- Went through the last big of the tutorial and finished off the last part of the game mechanics.  
- Copied and adjusted one of the weapons in the game so it was semi-auto, had less ammo, and stronger damage.  
- Added another door and key with the *EndLevel* scene
- Added more targets around the level for the player to maneuver around.  
- Saved the gamebuild so I can save it as a .exe file.
